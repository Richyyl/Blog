      <description>Hi there, I&amp;rsquo;m Rich and I currently work as a Data Scientist / Dev for The Oakland Group (https://www.theoaklandgroup.co.uk/), a tech consultancy based in Leeds (However all posts are my own content and are reflective of my personal views).
I&amp;rsquo;ve created this site both to both showcase some of the things I learn in my own time / as part of work and also to allow me to pen down my thoughts when I fell it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate.</description>
