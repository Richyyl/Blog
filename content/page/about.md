Hi there, I'm Rich.

Things about me:

- I love science and the wonders of life
- I find plants amazingly interesting
- I love coding and analysing data
- I have a PhD in molecular biology

If you've eneded up at this site I'm not sure why, but I hope you gain something from my mad stumblings into learning new techniques around data science!
