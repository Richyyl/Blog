title: About me

Hi there, my name is Rich, not Richard, that brings back memories of doing something bad during childhood!

Things about me:

- I love science and the wonders of life
- I find plants amazingly interesting
- I love coding and analysing data
- I have a PhD in molecular biology

If you've eneded up at this site I'm not sure why, but I hope you gain something from my mad stumblings into learning new techniques around data science!
