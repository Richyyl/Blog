Hi there, I'm Rich and I currently work as a Data Scientist / Dev for The Oakland Group (https://www.theoaklandgroup.co.uk/), a tech consultancy based in Leeds (However all posts are my own content and are reflective of my personal views).

I've created this site both to both showcase some of the things I learn in my own time / as part of work and also to allow me to pen down my thoughts when I fell it's appropriate.

If you want to get in touch feel free to reahc out via twitter, the link is at the bottom of the page!
